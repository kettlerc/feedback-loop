# PROJECT NAME
React Feedback Loop

## Description

This is a basic feedback form built with React for use in an educational setting.

The form also includes an admin page for editing and addressing feedback received.


### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!


## Usage

1. Fill out each field in the form to submit feedback for the week's lesson.
2. Comments are encouraged, but optional.
3. On the admin page, an administrator can view all the feedback, flag feedback that needs special attention, and delete feedback.
